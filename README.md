#### Project Description
This project was intended to be used as an introductory project to help
me and my fellow students get acquainted with the html and css languages.
#### Color scheme
![alt text for screen readers](/img/color-scheme.png "Website color scheme")  

The color scheme was very thoughtfully chosen so as to allow folks with various types of visual impairment such as color blindness to be able to use it without problems. For the most part, the design revolves around the 2 shades of blue and white, using the other colors very selectively.
These are the resources I used to learn more about background image properties.
#### Navbar
Starting from the top of the website, the first thing that stands out is the menu options which if clicked on, take you to the specified section of the webpage. In this section, we learned how to link text to different sections of the webpage and even allow them to direct the user to different parts of the website. Additionally, you will noticed that when accessed on a phone or smaller device, by default, there is a menu icon instead of various menu options. In this section, we also learned how to make responsive elements. In addition, we learned to make a object like the menu icon be put to use to open up a list of menu options when clicked.
#### Avatar
In the next section down, you will see an animated picture of myself. In this section, we learned how to import photos into our webpage.
#### Biography
In the biography section, we were introduced to paragraphs.
#### Hobbies
In the hobbies section, before it was switched to a paragraph format in line with word count requirement, we learned about unordered lists, first, and nth child.
#### Photo Gallery
In the photo gallery section, we were taught to be conscious of the size of photos we bring in, how to resize, and our first major application of responsiveness. In addition, we were taught how to make captions.
#### Near Car Collision
In the near car collision section, we were taught how to embed various elements of media states on to our webpage such as videos as shown here.
#### Introduction to Background Image Properties
In the section, as the title would suggest, I learned about background image properties. I was able to learn how to incorporate an image behind text, along with a repeat.
#### Contact Us
In the contact us section, I learned about forms and various form elements some of which include a text input which takes text, an email input which takes an email, a tel input which takes a telephone number, and a radio element which allows you to click and unclick, and a way in which to force the user to choose between the two of such elements as if you choose one, the other unchecks. We were also introduced to required and optional fields and how to choose whether to make an element one or the other.
#### Footer
In the footer section, I used a link to allow the user to access my GitHub repository for this assignment.
