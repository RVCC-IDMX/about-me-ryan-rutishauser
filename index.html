            <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Rutishauser and I was born on March 20th, 2003. If I had to describe myself,
                 I would say that I am a very disciplined. Although I am quiet, I am hard on myself and always push 
                 myself to be the best at everything I do. Currently I am a student at Raritan Valley Community College 
                 going for my Major in Computer Programming. For work, I do pool maintenance. Between the two things, 
                 I have a very tight schedule but also squeeze in time for my family, friends and hobbies. 
            </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <div>

            <p>One of the hobbies I spend the most time doing is weight training. Weight training is an interesting
                 hobby in that many things in life are affected if you want to be the best you can be at it. For me,
                  health, nutrition and taking care of my body have also become hobbies in order to put myself in the
                   best position to be successful. This means that I am interested in making sure the foods I eat are
                    healthy, making sure I get the correct amount of each of the macronutrients, and cooking to accommodate
                     these needs. Lastly, stretching and mobility becomes important to prevent injuries so I can be consistent
                      in my exercise routine. Another hobby that I enjoy is taking care of my pets. In the photo gallery,
                       are pictures of both my dog and my cat. Taking care of my pets is a rewarding hobby for me because
                        I appreciate the unconditional love they show which makes you feel they appreciate what you do for them.

        <h2>Introduction to Background Image Properties</h2>

        <div>

            <p>As a beginner to intermediate programmer, there may 
                still be many features to a website that you see and wonder 
                “how do they do that?” There are few features that can enhance 
                the appearance of a webpage quite like the background image. 
                The background image allows you to place an image as the 
                background to a section of your webpage. It can be used to 
                make a picture the backdrop to text, as was done in this 
                very blog section. You may be wondering if this is a complicated 
                feature, but it is rather simple and can be done with only html, 
                css, and a photo in your current working repository. 
                To get started, as previously stated, you will need a photo 
                in your current working repository. Once this is done, you can 
                simply use the css tag, background-image. In order to use this 
                tag, the syntax of the input is different from the typical input 
                syntax. Following the usual colon, you write, url then immediately 
                following, without even spaces, write an open parenthesis, 
                open double quote, then the path to your image. Once you have 
                this, you will need to put a closing quotation mark and closing 
                parenthesis then the typical semi-colon. This is an example, the 
                css I used to put the wave photo behind this text. </p>

            <p>background-image: url(“../img/waves-background-image(2).jpg”);</p>

            <p>Once the background image is added, there are many effects 
                that can be put on the image to spice it up using 
                only css. Size is one of the common effects that is used. 
                This can be used to shrink or expand an image as you like 
                to make it look good within the working space. In my code, I used this 
                to shrink the size of the wave. </p>
            
            <p>background-size: 100px;</p>

            <p>Another common effect that can be used to manipulate your 
                photo is repeat. Repeat can be used to
                 make an image repeat horizontally, or vertically. Really, 
                 this only comes to use if the size of the image is smaller 
                 than the area it is covering. In my case, I made the size 
                 of the image small because I like the subtle look it presents
                  behind the text, and it made it more difficult to pinpoint 
                  the exact location where the photo repeats. As you can see,
                   the image I chose repeats both horizontally and vertically. 
                   I did this using the following code.</p>
            
            <p>background-repeat: repeat-y repeat-x;</p>

            <p>Another common effect that can be used is position. You can 
                program your image to be on the left, right, center or a 
                specified location in the unit of your choice. In my code, 
                I simply set it to center. You can use this property 
                on both the x and y axis.</p>
            
            <p>background-position-x: center;</p>

            <p>Two other noteworthy properties that can be applied to background
                 images are origin and clip. Origin is a property that 
                 allows you to decide where the photo starts from. You can make 
                 it start inside the border, padding or content. With the repeat 
                 property being used on my photo, there was no distinguishable 
                 difference when I had this property included so I left it out. 
                 Here is an example of what the css tag looks like.</p>
            
            <p>background-origin: border-box;</p>

            <p>The final property that will be discussed, clip is a property 
                that restricts a photo to a certain vicinity within an element. 
                Just like with origin, the options you can pass in are 
                border, padding, or content. After experimenting with it on 
                this website, I determined that I liked the look better without 
                it, so I left it out. I will include an example to show how to 
                write out the tag.</p>
                
            <p>background-clip: border-box;</p>

                what you learned here to help you as you continue on the 
                path to becoming a professional webpage developer.</p>
