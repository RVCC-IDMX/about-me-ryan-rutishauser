            <p>Hello, my name is Ryan Rutishauser and I was born on March 20th, 2003. If I had to describe myself,
                 I would say that I am a very disciplined. Although I am quiet, I am hard on myself and always push 
                 myself to be the best at everything I do. Currently I am a student at Raritan Valley Community College 
                 going for my Major in Computer Programming. For work, I do pool maintenance. Between the two things, 
                 I have a very tight schedule but also squeeze in time for my family, friends and hobbies.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <div>

            <p>One of the hobbies I spend the most time doing is weight training. Weight training is an interesting
                 hobby in that many things in life are affected if you want to be the best you can be at it. For me,
                  health, nutrition and taking care of my body have also become hobbies in order to put myself in the
                   best position to be successful. This means that I am interested in making sure the foods I eat are
                    healthy, making sure I get the correct amount of each of the macronutrients, and cooking to accommodate
                     these needs. Lastly, stretching and mobility becomes important to prevent injuries so I can be consistent
                      in my exercise routine. Another hobby that I enjoy is taking care of my pets. In the photo gallery,
                       are pictures of both my dog and my cat. Taking care of my pets is a rewarding hobby for me because
                        I appreciate the unconditional love they show which makes you feel they appreciate what you do for them.

        <h2>An Excerpt From Sherlock Holmes <Title></Title></h2>

        <div>

            <p>"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours 
                of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and 
                soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from 
                the first that the only possible object of this rather 
                fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, 
                and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get 
                this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number 
                of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing 
                it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a 
                better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's 
                ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. 
                The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw him, and 
                what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They 
                put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary 
                office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, 
                and together they manage to secure his absence every morning 
                in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant 
                having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he 
                had some strong motive for securing the situation."</p>

            <p>"But how could you guess what the motive was?"</p>

            <p>"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.</p>

            <p>"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of 
                action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement 
                with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar 
                stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. 
                Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant 
                answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had 
                never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked 
                at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You 
                must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and 
                stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. 
                The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. 
                I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank 
                abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had 
                solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert 
                I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the 
                bank directors, with the result that you have seen."</p>
